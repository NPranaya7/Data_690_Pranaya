# What is Data Analysis
**A process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making.**


## Data Analysis Tools
- Auto-managed closed tools : Tablue, Qlikq, looker....
- Programming Languages : Python, R, Julia


## Why Python for Data Analysis?
**very simple and intuitive to learn, “correct” language, powerful libraries (not just for Data Analysis), free and open source, amazing community, docs and conferences**


## The Data Analysis Process
**Data Extraction, Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Analysis, Action**


## Common libraries we use...
- pandas: The cornerstone of our Data Analysis job with Python
- matplotlib: The foundational library for visualizations. Other libraries we’ll use will be built on top of matplotlib.
- numpy: The numeric library that serves as the foundation of all calculations in Python.
- seaborn: A statistical visualization tool built on top of matplotlib.
- statsmodels: A library with many advanced statistical functions.
- scipy: Advanced scientific computing, including functions for optimization, linear algebra, image processing and much more.
- scikit-learn: The most popular machine learning library for Python (not deep learning)
